Gunship Souls was my entry for the first ever #indiesvspewdiepie, hosted by GameJolt. It is a
minimalist arcade bullet-hell, with controls that could almost make it a twin-stick shooter.
I build the original in three 12-hour days, based on a set of heuristics for making "fun" games.
The result, unsurprisingly, was a fun and action packed game that lends itself to epic high-score
runs.

During the voting period, I compiled a set of videos of epic organic pilots, which you can
watch on my youtube channel.
