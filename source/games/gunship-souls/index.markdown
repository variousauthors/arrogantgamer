Gunship Souls was my entry for the first ever [#indiesvspewdiepie][0], hosted by [GameJolt][1]. It is a
minimalist arcade bullet-hell, with controls that could almost make it a twin-stick shooter.
I build the original in three 12-hour days, based on a set of heuristics for making "fun" games.
The result, unsurprisingly, was a fun and action packed game that lends itself to epic high-score
runs. You can [play it on GameJolt][3]!

During the voting period, I compiled a [set of videos][2] chronicling the journeys of some epic organic pilots, which you can
watch on my youtube channel.
