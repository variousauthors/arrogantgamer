Shortly after Signal was published on GameJolt, [Heiser Saint][9] approached me wanting to remake it
with more beautiful assets. We began a 6 month collaboration: a fusion of his technical wizardry and
my occasionally helpful advice. Sig.NULL was published on [GameJolt][8] on the first of June.

Sig.NULL was written up on [RockPaperShotgun][0] by [nobody][1], and by [Stephen Lewis][2] on [Jay Is Games][3]. In
addition, Sig.NULL was the first game I was involved in to be visible on the YouTubes. In particular,
I enjoyed [Chritro's 3 part let's play][4] in which he repeatedly embarrasses himself by continuing to
play Sig.NULL (I highly recommend just giving up because it is hard). It was also reviewed by [The Indie Update][5],
and featured by [VideoGameAddictz][6].

Also, I would like to mention out that [@Permayuyuko][7] actually beat Sig.NULL, which is crazy and is
probably something _you_ couldn't do.
