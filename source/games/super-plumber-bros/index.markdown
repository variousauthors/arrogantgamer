My first collaboration as _ZIGS NOMOON & CLANG AT LAW_, Super Plumber Bros was our
JAM entry in the [29th Ludum Dare][0]. During the post-compo month, we polished the game
to a blinding sheen and then released it on [GameJolt][4].

The original LD48 submission was extremely buggy. It scored 200th place in the humor
category, and 700th overall. The post-compo version was more successful, with a community
rating of 4.8 and around 400 downloads two weeks into its life.

SPB was released during #glitchjam, coincidentally, and because of its glitch aesthetic it
was featured as a "resource" on the [jam page][1]. It was also featured on [wip.warpdoor][2],
in the early days of that monolith of game curation.

Notably, Super Plumber Bros was the first of my games to include GameJolt API integration.
My highscore is 125 flowers, which is probably silly for you to even think about.
