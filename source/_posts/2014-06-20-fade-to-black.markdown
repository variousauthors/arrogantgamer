[Tim][1] & [Adrien][0] Soret had one hell of a [#cyberpunkjam][2] entry. The Last Night stole
gold overall and in the "aesthetics" department, and was highly ranked in every
other category. I was 100% sold on this experience right up until the end.

Spoilers, alright? You blast your way past the cyborg bouncers, push through
a crowd of neon and black leather, take out the bouncer, and shoot the target.
The target stumbles backwards out the window, with a crash. At this point the
game takes control, and walks you outside.

You stand on the balcony, the fat antagonist leans heavily against
the railing. No words are exchanged.

Then the game does that thing: you can't
move, all you can do is draw your weapon. All you can do is assassinate the target.
The game knows this, and you know this... but it forces you to pull the trigger. This
can be an incredibly compelling technique! It hits that "resonance" everyone talks
about, and really puts you in the moment.

But I didn't pull the trigger.

My usual response to these "semi-cutscenes" is to
turn the game off. My ending is usually better: more subtle, more nuanced, more left
to the imagination. _Especially_ considering that I _could_ have shot the poor dude.
Why did I hesitate? What's the business here, between me and the old dude?
He stands there, cold and bleeding, hand raised meaninglessly against the pistol.
The music played on and on, and for me... everything faded to black.

Moreover, pulling the trigger wouldn't have been cyberpunk! That's not grim, {"that's not gritty:
that's arcade"}. That's a video game. Cyberpunk is Roy Batty [crying in the rain][3].
Ideally, the game should have detected the lack of input, and then just gradually
faded to black. Putting the player in the driver's seat and making them pull the trigger is
great, I love that, but don't undo yourself by making that the only choice. Allowing
the player the out of choosing ambiguity would have been thrilling.

It is totally rad to think that we are going to get to play a feature length action
platformer from these brothers. I'm looking forward to [Behind Nowhere][4], and putting
it on my playlist right next to [Hyper Light Drifter][5].
