Her. Problematic! Lots of little things bugged me about this. First and foremost,
it undermines its own goals by being so chatty. A game that tries to frame or a
explore a particular phenomenon as a game system should measure its success or
failure on how well that phenomenon is communicated without falling back on the
tropes of old media. Not to say text isn't welcome! It is unavoidable, as @nomoon
points out the clouds, the colour palette, and the music are all text. Still
printing the words "you feel sad because life is becoming more difficult" irks
me precisely because I was already feeling sad for exactly that reason. The
game is getting harder, the notes are becoming more sour.

I should definitely also say: her is the objective female pronoun, and the two
characters are blue and pink. So I am definitely the blue one, and can blame the
increase in difficultly on the pink one since she's not keeping up. Making the
roles more ambiguous would allow the player to choose who they are and to understand
the game better. It would not have hurt this game at all to call it "Us" and offer
less clearly gendered characters.

All of this is clearly a matter of choice.

I should probably play it all the way through and also choose a second
LD30 game.
