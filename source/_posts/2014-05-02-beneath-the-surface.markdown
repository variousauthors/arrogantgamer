"Beneath the Surface" was a great theme. If you made a game that said, _this
is a game that seems to be one thing, but beneath the surface it is another."_,
then you have my love. So far, @jezzamonn's Generic Adventure Game is the
game that nailed that one the best.

The game starts with a beautiful misdirection, playing on the investment of
player into avatar. For the first moments of the game you play a generic hero
who can press 'A' to kill an adorable slime for XP. The slime is the player,
but the player won't understand this right away.

In the first stage, the slime moves slowly and jumps without vigor. It moans
existential questions that are ignored by an uncaring world. After a few moments of
struggle and despair we are give an alternative: hold shift to dream.

As long as you hold shift, you are playing a different game: you jump higher and
move faster, there are no heroes to kill you and the landscape is lush,
verdant, soft, and anti-aliased. You can hop around and explore, and the game
generally just feels _better_. Meanwhile, on the surface, you are dying repeatedly.

How unbelievably cool! A game that sucks in which you can hold shift to play a fun
game is just a totally rad idea. You can imagine where such a game could go from
there: perhaps the slime unlocks deep and ancient secrets, or saves the world
(perhaps the player sometimes forgets they are holding shift and that this is a dream); perhaps there
are gates in the dream world that lead out to the aether beyond worlds, and
the slime loses its connection to its body, only then learning to appreciate what it lost;
perhaps the slime meets a spiritual guide that teaches it to bring its dream
self into the real world. Perhaps! When your game starts with such brilliant underpinnings,
where you take it is of little consequence. Generic Adventure Game does not
disappoint.

The slime is not vindictive. This too bears mention. I was really surprised
by the primary action in the game, and delighted by how the slime chooses to
react.
