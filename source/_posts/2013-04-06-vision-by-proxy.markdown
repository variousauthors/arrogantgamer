In Vision by Proxy, you are a nearly blind extra-terrestrial who sees by
stealing human eyes. Well, sort of. When you steel someone's 'eyes', you
are actually getting their world-view. An engineer sees things in terms of
blue-prints, and when you look at the world from their perspective you can
often find your way into buildings. A child's world is full of magic, and
floating cloud platforms. In this way, to progress through this platformer,
you must collect eyes.

I talk about how this game fixes what was wrong with Death Death Evolution

I talk about how I would have liked to have the sense that I was identifying
what was needed, and collecting it, rather than (as in DDE) just trying to
get every pair of eyes in every level and hopping through. More thought and
planning.

Also, the blind alien mode is neat because level designer can make you lose
track of where your ship is.

Also, also, each game object has facets: the house is a monster head in the
girl's world, can be entered from the left in the engineer's world, and from
the top in the gardener's world, and can be jumped up onto in the alien's world.
This consistency is exactly what one could expand upon to make the game a real
puzzle platformer.
