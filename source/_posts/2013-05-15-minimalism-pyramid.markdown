While many games chose to incorporate the theme of Minimalism by being visually simple, Pyramid was visually simple as a consequence of being minimalist. Burgess chose to strip away the unnecessary elements of a rogue-like, and left us with a stunning piece of work.

Pyramid's levels are squares of randomly generated passages; the hero's vision is limited, so when the levels start to get really big it starts to feel really murky. If Pyramid's levels didn't grow, we wouldn't understand the name. If Pyramid were called another name, we wouldn't understand why the levels grow. This is the essence of minimalism: remove one element and what remains doesn't make sense!

The game teaches us all the necessary mechanics in the first 3 levels, and then just gets tougher and tougher. The only thing that is left to us to discover is how combat works. I found out around level 12 that if you touch an enemy you attack it. That's not all though: unlike a run-of-the-mill rogue-like, it is possible to dance with enemies and outwit them. For me this is great: the game is not just a resource management slog, it involves patience and wit as well. The witty enemy and equipment names are nice too!

The game goes on forever, but I've been assured that level 48 is the last time any new content is introduced.
