Regex Crossword
Tower Defense
Papers Please

Imagine a tower defense game in which the towers are regular expressions with
cooldown. You upgrade them by making them less specific, so that they can chip
away at the word enemies that roll ever closer.

Imagine a game in which you are a regular expression engine. A regex comes in,
and you have a limited number of clock cycles to understand it. Then inputs
start to pour in and you have to rapidly populate and return match data. Too
many mistakes and your library will gain a reputation as buggy; too slow and
folks will complain.
