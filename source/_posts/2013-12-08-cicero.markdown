[Ludum Dare 28][1] is coming up, and I plan on making something. I've thought
about trying to make a zelda-like, or a rogue-like, but of course I will leave
the final decision up to fate and the theme. The tool I plan on using, however
is now set in stone.

Of course, I'm talking about

In order to familiarize myself with the ins and outs of this up-and-coming
HTML5 game development framework, I've set myself to the task of implementing
Signal with it. Last night (Dec 7th) I got a tilemap showing, added movement
to the red drone, and then things got tricky.

{% codeblock lang:javascript the gameloop %}
Q.load([ "signal_tiles.png"], function() {
  Q.sheet("signal", "signal_tiles.png", { tilew: 90, tileh: 90, sx:0, sy:0 });

  var actors = digest_bitmap();

  Q.gameLoop(function (dt) {
    var i;

    for(i = 0; i < actors.length; i++) {
      actors[i].update(dt);
    }

    Q.clear();

    for(i = 0; i < actors.length; i++) {
      actors[i].render(Q.ctx);
    }
  });
});
{% endcodeblock %}

At first I didn't really understand stages and scenes, I just wanted to feed
in a bitmap and have the result be nice tiles. The `digest_bitmap` method
does just that: I pass it a bitmap as an argument (at first is was hardcoded),
and it gives me an array of actors, which will all be `Q.Sprite` objects.
Having the gameloop there explicitly isn't necessary when you have scenes,
but now -- after refactoring to include scenes -- I feel like I want my little
gameloop back. I'm not a game developer by education, so a lot of this stuff
is pretty new to me, and I'd kind of like to know what's going on in there.
Fortunately, the Quintus source is pretty accessible.

## Inheritance

One of the things I really liked about Signal was: all of the common objects
behaved in basically the same way. In this implementation, I really want to
take that further. I'm going to define "Block" and "Drone" as parent classes,
and have everything else in the game inherit from these.

{% codeblock class:half-width lang:javascript drones! %}

All the drone code!

### Special Cases

## Events

Here I came up against Quintus' "events", which don't work the way I
expect, coming from a background in Backbone and MarionetteJS. When
I think of events, I think of an announcement rather than a targeted
message; I think of the actor paradigm and of concurrency. Quintus'
events are not like this. When you trigger an event, you define
explicitly the receiver. If you want to broadcast messages, you are
going to have to do this yourself.

This came as something of a disapointment to me, since I had expected that
I would be able to implement drone control directly on top of Quintus'
event management. However, it is also a good reminder that I am not
building a website here!

{% codeblock class:half-width lang:javascript control blocks %}

Code for the control blocks "broadcasting"

## Components: Too Much Physics

Right away, after installing the "2d" component in the drones, I realized
that I didn't really want a lot of physics in this game. The way things
work in Quintus out-of-the-box you get smooth movement, and natural "bounce".
When you move a drone, it slides elegantly into its new position. When
a drone collides with something, it bounces nicely off the surface.

This was a great opportunity to really explore the "2d" and "scene" components,
and try my hand at implementing a, albeit simpler, physics component.
