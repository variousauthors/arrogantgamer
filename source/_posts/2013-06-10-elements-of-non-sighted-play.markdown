I recently played four games that involved elements of non-sighted play. These were [Conversion][1], [Traal][2], and [You Must Escape][3].

You Must Escape was one of my favorite games of the jam (it was one of everyone's favorites). It was moody, minimal, fun to control, 
and punishingly hard! That being said, it also exemplifies this interesting phenomenon. We all love the idea of audiogames, but isn't it
a little perverse to be making inaccessible audiogames?

Reading the comments to You Must Escape was neat: so many comments, but no-one commented on the inherent irony of the game. One commenter
in particular said:

"I'm so bad at these blind sound-dependent games. I wish I was better at them. Good job."

Let's get one thing straight.  There are people,  and then there are sighted people. People have trouble playing video games because most games are made for super human folk. Regular people just don't have access to the cognitive tools necessary to play most games.  I have the fortune of eyeing able to count myself among the sighted,  and recently I played a few games that  involved temporary suppression of my powers.  
None of these games were accessible trip  normal people,  but they all approached this. They presented game play in which the player has to rely on sound or memory of a place to navigate. 
The first is such and such a game.  The screen is black  you can hear a rating of chains or a dripping of water or a heartbeat,  and you navigate this w at. The game fails to be accessible to people because of the way it presents feedback to the player upon thesis r interacting with walls.  These moments are presented in text.  They could arguably have been a voice or something like that. 
Another is traal,  where you are overcome with pa if if you see the enemies.  At some point you pick up a blindfold and are able to avoid panic at the cost of your superhuman ability to navigate by sight. 
The third is a category of games that present sonar as the tool for navigation.  This usually present ed visual ly with sound being represented as a wave (which it is) bouncing off surfaces. 
Imagine a game in which you play a clicker:someone who has trained themselves to navigate by sonar.  This game would be accessible to clickers and potentially to normal people,  but would present a unique and possibly very challenging pro lemme for us superhuman folk. 

Did a bit of research last night. These are called audiogames (naturally). So what is really happening here is that sighted people please are beginning to experiment with full audio or their games. 

I recently played three games that experiment with non-sighted play.  A game about echolocation that tries to show the player that it is possible to navigate a space by bouncing  waves off of walls.  It wasn't great: the author  hose to represent the waves visually as curved lines,  but the wave physics just wasn't there to really make it shine.  It ended up just being hard,  and significantly, it is not playable by people who out are not sighted. Had the wave physics been more involved it could have been a good demonstration of how echolocation works,  and it could have gradually trained the player off of its graphics and introduced truly non-sighted play. 
The next game was traal and it presented a memory based navigation mechanic. In traal the player is trying to avoid seeing enemies.  This is a subtle departure from traditional stealth-em-ups :the player has a flash light and it always points ahead of her. If the light falls on a monster,  the player loses control of their character, which freaks out and runs about randomly. This usually results in death as the levels are littered with spikes. The non-sighted play comes in when the player finds a blindfold. This gives them the option of Inspecting an area,  learning the enemies movement patterns, and then navigating blindly by memory. This again is not accessible gameplay,  but it does explore the phenomena of mentally mapping an area and navigating by memory.
