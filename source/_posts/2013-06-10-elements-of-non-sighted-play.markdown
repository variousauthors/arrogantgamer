I recently became excited about the prospect of games for non-sighted people. This came after playing a couple of LD26 games that involved
elements of non-sighted play. These were [Conversion][1], and [You Must Escape][3], and they succeed in being about accessibility without being accessible.

[Conversion][1] is a 1st (or possibly 3rd) person shooter that uses none of the visual cues FPS players have been trained to use. The screen is black at all times,
except when messages concerning the state of the environment are displayed, these being "you bumped into a wall!" or "there is something soft and wet at your feet".
The rest of the game information is conveyed with audio cues, such as a dripping noise, your own heartbeat, or a gunshot. These effects are presented using positional audio,
so that the player wearing headphones can effectively navigate to the source of a sound by positioning it directly in front of them and moving forward. {" You should really
skip this and just play the damn game, that would be easier. "}

Audio cues used in the game are gritty and emotional: water dripping in an empty room, a scratching noise, and a heartbeat are all very visceral. When I heard the gunshot
noise for the first time I literally leapt from my chair. After that I kept my tongue tucked behind my teeth in anticipation of more punishing audio to come. This is
and effective and excellent game, and it was well received during LD26.

Conversion introduces a sighted audience to elements of the world perceived by non-sighted people. That having been said, it is not playable by non-sighted
gamers, and this feels like an ironic and tragic oversight. Despite [@spiridios][2]' claim that "You cannot see, so you must complete the game using only your sense of hearing 
and sense of touch", Conversion actually relies on the gamer's sense of sight as well since it conveys certain spatial information in written messaged. I want my review 
to remain positive, because Conversion really is a great game, but I also can't shy away from what I see as a glaring and embarrassing truth: a sighted gamer made a game 
about being blind, without considering whether blind people would be able to play it too.

{" This game is not interesting as a proof of concept! "} There are already fully 3D first-person-shooters made by and for non-sighted gamers. If you sit down and give them a 
whirl as a sighted player... all I can say is that you will be stunned. They are engineered to be a complete, accessible FPS experience -- an indie made for a game jam
just can't compete. I took some time to play [Shades of Doom][7] as part of writing this post: it was extremely 
challenging for me to make any headway in the game, much more so than in Conversion. I haven't played [Swamp][5] but [Jason Johnson][4]'s review got me pretty excited, 
but also left me with the impression that its sound design emphasises user interface very heavily. These are games that are trying to bring the FPS genre to non-sighted
players, and they are succeeding: just consider [AudioQuake][6] to get a sense of what I mean.

On the other hand, I found the soundscape of Shades of Doom crowded and obnoxious. It was easy to navigate, with lots more beeps and audio cues, but it wasn't beautiful. 
There is a term used in audiogames: ear candy. Conversion was, to my untrained ear, pure candy. As I mentioned above, the audio was viseral and emotional. This isn't an FPS, it is an
indie game, through and through, trying bring a new experience to a tiny audience of the willing. It could have been such a perfect experience to share with non-sighted
gamers, if only it didn't rely on sight.

frustrates me about Conversion: as I mentioned above, this game contained interesting bits of ear-candy, and was short and emotional. It was an indie game through and
through, trying to bring a new experience to sighted players. While it is surely noble to try to port existing gameplay elements to a non-sighted audience, as in the
aformentioned FPS titles, and as in [AudioQuake][6] for example, I doubt that the results will ever be as elegant or emotional as a game  This is probably .

It was not an attempt to bring
certain elements of sighted play to the non-sighted community, as in [AudioQuake][6] mod, for example. It is It could be such a perfect experience
to share with non-sighted gamers... if only it didn't rely on sight.
