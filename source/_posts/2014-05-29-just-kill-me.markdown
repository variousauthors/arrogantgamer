I've just played Kinetectonic and Watch Your Step, two excellent entries in the
29th Ludum Dare. While playing both these games, I had a strange nagging feeling.

<!-- more -->

Basically I'm saying that these games feel great to play, but the designer chose
to skip on designing a difficulty curve. I first noticed this feeling while playing
Faif. For the first while I really felt great playing Faif, and gradually building up
my powers. At a certain point I realized that I wasn't really getting better. This
is very artificial! Faif is very random, so you don't really have a chance to beat
the later enemies. You basically just have to grind. Why add grind to a lovely
arcade game?

Watch Your Step is a rad arcade game: simple gameplay, upgrades, nice animations.
It is clever and unique, and I like it. However, rather than asking me to get a
high-score, they are asking me to play the same level again and again, each time
creeping a tiny bit closer to the end. This isn't "procedurally generated" stuff
coming at me. It is the same stuff again and again. It reminds me a lot of Linear RPG
and in fact that's what's going on. These games are like a dressed up version of
Linear RPG, rather than like a dressed down version of an actual linear RPG.

I never felt this way when playing Final Fantasy or other linear RPGs. The story-line
and content draw me in. Faif and Watch Your Step don't have a story-line, they
aren't arcade titles (because you build up, so those first levels gradually become
less and less fun). Similarly kinetectonic would be rad if I felt like I was
improving my ability to play the game, rather than decreasing the game's requisite
skill level.
