    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-26/?action=preview&amp;uid=5275">DOE</a> and <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-26/?action=preview&amp;uid=2297">Bashland</a> are two LD26 games feel amazingly polished given that they were made in 48 hours. Bashland describes itself as a &#8220;Breakout Mario Mashup&#8221;, and does an incredible job of being just that. DOE takes place in a detailed and nuanced world, in which dreams can touch reality.</p>

<h3>DOE</h3>

<p><img class="left-side" src="http://arrogantgamer.com/images/we-can-all-dream.png" title="&#34;we can all dream&#34;" alt="&#34;we can all dream&#34;"></p>

<p>One of the clever decisions in DOE is to have the game set in a detailed and nuanced world, without ever really referencing that world. In the author&#8217;s own words, &#8220;The whole universe that I imagined is in the end much bigger than what is exposed in the game.&#8221; DOE&#8217;s gameplay is familiar &#8211; it is a mixture of pushing blocks and avoiding guards &#8211; but the visual elements, events, and ending give us a sense that we are experiencing the exposed edge of something bigger.</p>

<p>In the early areas you explore by pushing walls away, presumably with your mind, though there is also evidence to suggest that your mind powers are being suppressed somehow (thus, we may suspect that someone is helping you escape). Early on we get some clues by way of overheard conversation, or intrapersonal communication:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Let them imagine you&#8217;re dead, and you will be.&#8221;</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>&#8220;This is going to be tricky&#8230; and I can&#8217;t dream!&#8221;</p></blockquote>


<p>When the game ends, all I want it more. How do you make a game like this in 48 hours?</p>

<h3>Bashland</h3>

<p>Bashland, on the other hand, is not a subtly, nuanced or carefully constructed poem fit tightly in a 48 hour shell; it is a full blown explosion where nostalgia slams up against honestly amazing assets. When I started it, I had to double check that I was not, in fact, playing a jam game. The music, graphics, and gameplay are completely stunning and 100% communicate the subject. The music! It is just baddass.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://arrogantgamer.com/images/bashland.png" title="&#34;A Breakout Mario Mashup&#34;" alt="&#34;A Breakout Mario Mashup&#34;"></p>

<blockquote><p>BASHLAND. When you played breakout, this is what you imagined you were playing. Nice slow reveal. @McFunkypants http://t.co/Cetc19ApVW #LD48</p><footer><strong>@ArrogantGamer</strong> <cite>A Truly Arrogant Man</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>When I tweeted this, I actually hadn&#8217;t read the author&#8217;s statement quoted above. The game feels like Breakout literally breaking out of the restrictive old-school arcade genre &#8211; it&#8217;s as though the little ball finally bashed through its enclosure and into someone else&#8217;s game. Gradually, we realize this is exactly what happened. It is so satisfying to bash your way through the old Mario stages, and the control is also really nice and smooth. Finally, if you manage to bash away too much of the level you can no longer win: so practice some restraint!</p>

    <updated>2013-05-15T23:37:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://arrogantgamer.com/blog/2013/05/15/minimalism-pyramid</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Many LD26 games chose to incorporate the theme of Minimalism by being visually simple. Pyramid was visually simple as a consequence of being minimalist. Burgess chose to strip away the unnecessary elements of a rogue-like, and left us with a stunning piece of work. I will dwell on the degree to which Burgess hit the theme.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img class="left-side" src="http://arrogantgamer.com/images/pyramid.png"></p>

<p>Minimalism presents something similar to prototype. I think that word has a bit of baggage: evoking an incomplete or fragile &#8216;first try&#8217; that is a basis for greater efforts. Prototypes aren&#8217;t just a quick slap job, they must also be the minimal viable product. That&#8217;s why projects start as prototypes, but it is not to say that we can&#8217;t also start with something bigger and then shave it down to a prototype. This is how I understood the LD26 theme, and I think that Burgess really expressed it well in Pyramid.</p>

<p><img class="left-side" src="http://arrogantgamer.com/images/hooked-lash.png">
<img class="right-side" src="http://arrogantgamer.com/images/one-of-the-corrupted.png"></p>

<p>Pyramid&#8217;s levels are squares of randomly generated passages; the hero&#8217;s vision is limited, so when the levels start to get really big it starts to feel really murky. If Pyramid&#8217;s levels didn&#8217;t grow, we wouldn&#8217;t understand the name. If Pyramid were called another name, we wouldn&#8217;t understand why the levels grow. Remove either element and what remains doesn&#8217;t make sense. Very little is embellished in Pyramid; there is very little excess. That&#8217;s not to say there isn&#8217;t anything left that could still be stripped away: burgess named things. Numbers appear on the screen to indicate the damage the hero deals or takes: this is enough to express the gradual powering up of the hero. Burgess, however, chose to name the different power levels. For example, in Pyramid &#8220;10&#8221; is called &#8220;Imperious Axe of Truth&#8221;. The monsters are also named.</p>

<p>In terms of how the game plays: it is smooth and fun. The game teaches us all the necessary mechanics in the first 3 levels, and then just gets tougher and tougher. The only thing that is left to us to discover is how combat works. I found out around level 12 that if you touch an enemy you attack it. That&#8217;s not all though: unlike a run-of-the-mill rogue-like, it is possible to dance with enemies and outwit them. For me this is great: the game is not just a resource management slog, it involves patience and wit as well.</p>

<p>The game goes on forever, but I&#8217;ve been assured that level 48 is the last time any new content is introduced.</p>

    <link href="http://arrogantgamer.com/blog/2013/04/06/vision-by-proxy/"/>
    <updated>2013-04-06T21:49:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://arrogantgamer.com/blog/2013/04/06/vision-by-proxy</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In Vision by Proxy, you are a nearly blind extraterrestrial who sees by
stealing human eyes. When you steal a pair of eyes, looking out through them
gives you a different perspective on the world. A child&#8217;s world is full
of magic, while an engineer sees the hidden uses of things. To progress
through the game, you must collect eyes.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img class="left-side" src="http://arrogantgamer.com/images/vision-by-proxy.png"></p>

<p>Your alien character does not power up by collecting eyes. Instead you gradually
gain access to different interpretations of the level&#8217;s layout. Thus, ideally,
the game is about remembering that you can more easily climb the little girl&#8217;s
play-fort then the anime chick&#8217;s Japanese temple. Some perspectives give you access
to the insides of things, or to a variety of floating platforms.</p>

<p>This game has evolved quite a bit since its initial incarnation, and some of my
complaints have been addressed. In the original game there were only four eyes to
collect, but in the more recent &#8220;Ms Vision by Proxy&#8221; (a sequel) we are introduced
to seven or so. This is good. When we enter a level we aren&#8217;t certain what eyes
will be available, and only after developing a vocabulary of game objects we can begin
to predict what eyes we need in order to progress.</p>

<p>That being said, it suffers from the levels being too big for the hero: the gameplay
is a little like a metroidvania, but the RPG elements are not played up enough for trekking back and forth across
the level to really be exciting. In addition, the puzzles are not really difficult or
focused and solving them ends up feeling inevitable. This game needs an overworld map, or teleportation, or something
to make the player feel like they are gathering information towards eventually solving
the puzzle, rather than just walking back and forth.</p>

<p>In an earlier post I proposed a game about mediums. I think merging the theme of
Death-Death-Evolution and the mechanics of Vision by Proxy would be cool. Imagine with me:</p>

<blockquote class='imagine-with-me'><p>You play as a group of characters positioned all around a level, separated by time and space (that is, no two characters exist at the same time). There is no central alien collector, instead you can switch between the characters and each can explore a small part of the level. Sometimes the levels laid out differently in different times, much like the way different eyes affect the level layouts in VBP. Some of the characters are fenced in by an obstacle that they can&#8217;t overcome, but that another character could.</p><p>This solves the problem of the level size &#8211; the player can now take in all (or most) the of the terrain features at once, right at the start of the level.  Now we add the DDE element: in order to advance, the player moves the free characters into areas their abilities allow them to reach, and then suicides them in some manner provided by the level. When the player flips to the other characters, there is now a ghost haunting the site of the death. Since the characters are mediums, they are able to tap into these spirits and gain the abilities that they need to move through the level. Gradually, and with much planning, the remaining characters move about the level collecting and combining spirits until they are able to reach the goal (whatever that happens to be).</p></blockquote>

    <updated>2012-10-01T19:35:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://arrogantgamer.com/blog/2012/10/01/death-death-evolution</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In Death Death Evolution, there is no escape. You must die to advance.
This game proposes a new relationship between the platform
jumper and the pits. In later stages I was actively looking for places
where I could die in a particular way, in order to unlock the tools I
might need later. There are even levels where you can die in irrelevant
ways, if you choose to, so that if you want to you can be stingy with death,
or feed her to bursting in order to fully &#8216;power up&#8217;.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img class="right-side" src="http://arrogantgamer.com/images/dde.png"></p>

<p>Nice game: I want more. More different animals, evolution abilities that
make more sense (I mean&#8230; I fell on spikes and could subsequently break
balloons with my head). I think we could take the mechanic of dying
for personal gain, switch up the theme a bit, and make a truly golden game
about ghosts or reincarnation or something.</p>

<blockquote class='imagine-with-me'><p>Let the player control people who are in touch with the spirit world. Mediums.<br/>You lead them about, and when they come in contact with a ghost they take on<br/>some aspect of that ghost&#8217;s former life. At first, there are not ghosts and only<br/>a collection of living mediums. The player strategically kills off her mediums,<br/>forcing them to haunt the place of their death but also allowing later mediums to<br/>proceed further through the game. Perhaps there is an economy of souls, such that<br/>a player must be careful who is killed when.</p></blockquote>

    <link href="http://arrogantgamer.com/blog/2012/09/22/osmos/"/>
    <updated>2012-09-22T18:28:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://arrogantgamer.com/blog/2012/09/22/osmos</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You could play Osmos with no more instruction: the imperative to grow will guide you naturally
and inexorably. Despite its simplicity, Osmos does insist on spelling everything out in tutorial levels. I
really enjoy early learning stages in games, especially the ones that teach you about the world, rather than
the control scheme. I&#8217;m usually not pleased when English language words appear on the screen telling me
to tap X rapidly or whatnot. Unless the appearance of language is consistent with the theme of the game,
(like in Analogue, for example) this can be a real turn off. I&#8217;m going to go into some detail about the tutorial
levels (there are two) because I think Osmos is an excellent example of how easily a great beginning can
turn foul.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Starting a game with a quote by a physicist or philosopher is a great idea: it sets the stage, and fills my mind
with well grounded ideas. No better way to quickly build a framework in which a player&#8217;s understanding
of the theme and action can grow, than by analogy. Osmos begins with a quote by Newton that has acquired
great cultural weight, and has as much meaning in ethics as it does in physics. Great first moment.</p>

<p>Then, fade in to a beautiful blue orb, pulsing and swimming with activity. What is this? Is this the universe? Is this
life itself, or God? No, the game corrects us: &#8220;This is you&#8221;. Beautiful! OK! Now I know what kind of game
this is and who I am, just give me a goal and I&#8217;m off!</p>

<p><img class="left-side" src="http://arrogantgamer.com/images/this-is-you.png"></p>

<p>Aiming for the home run, Osmos zooms out, and shows us what we need to do: &#8220;Propel yourself to the blue
circle and come to a stop&#8221;. For me, a smooth introduction like this is the sweetest thing. I rarely
play games to their conclusion, and I judge very quickly. Ambient music, soft blue colour-scheme, and
simple direct instructions are exactly everything that I need. So, having been told what I am and
where to go, naturally I start clicking.</p>

<p>Nothing&#8230; click, click, click! Wait what? But I thought every action had an equal and opposite reaction?
Shouldn&#8217;t something happen when I click? Oh wait&#8230; I see what&#8217;s up. Osmos doesn&#8217;t care if I understand what
I am and where I should go: it is too humble (or something) to anticipate that I could have understood by now
just based on the theme and visuals. So, reluctantly, I press the spacebar one more time.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Hey, listen! You navigate by aligning the cursor behind you and pressing the left mouse button&#8221;</p></blockquote>


<p>Arglebargle!!! I love Osmos: great game. I&#8217;m just so, so, so disappointed when that little sprite
shows up in every game I play to remind me of what I already know. I&#8217;ve never read a novel or watched a
film that presumed the need to explain the medium: yet every second video game does this. Especially
considering that Osmos was released for a platform with exactly one button &#8211; your finger &#8211; which can only
be used to &#8216;tip-tap&#8217;&#8230; it is very sad that I&#8217;m not allowed to play until that vile spectre has made my
means of agency explicit.</p>

<p>The rest of the instructions &#8211; that is, to absorb small motes and avoid big ones &#8211; are also unnecessary
in the post katamari damaci world. Especially when the reds of warning are so vivid, and the peaceful blues
so soft and attractive. Nothing in the world could be more evident, once you have understood that &#8216;this is you&#8217;. If
that&#8217;s me, and that big red ball isn&#8217;t me, then there is no way I&#8217;m going anywhere near it. I&#8217;ll go chill
with these little blue balls I can shove around. Oh shit I got bigger! Ha, and the red ball changed color! Time
to win!</p>

<p>See: no need to instruct. Hey! Are you listening?</p>
