    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Many LD26 games chose to incorporate the theme of Minimalism by being visually simple. Pyramid was visually simple as a consequence of being minimalist. Burgess chose to strip away the unnecessary elements of a rogue-like, and left us with a stunning piece of work. I will dwell on the degree to which Burgess hit the theme.</p>

<p>Minimalism presents something similar to prototype. I think that word has a bit of baggage: evoking an incomplete or fragile &lsquo;first try&rsquo; that is a basis for greater efforts. Prototypes aren&rsquo;t just a quick slap job, they must also be the minimal viable product. That&rsquo;s why projects start as prototypes, but it is not to say that we can&rsquo;t also start with something bigger and then shave it down to a prototype. This is how I understood the LD26 theme, and I think that Burgess really expressed it well in Pyramid.</p>

<p>Pyramid&rsquo;s levels are squares of randomly generated passages; the hero&rsquo;s vision is limited, so when the levels start to get really big it starts to feel really murky. If Pyramid&rsquo;s levels didn&rsquo;t grow, we wouldn&rsquo;t understand the name. If Pyramid were called another name, we wouldn&rsquo;t understand why the levels grow. Remove either element and what remains doesn&rsquo;t make sense. Very little is embellished in Pyramid; there is very little excess. That&rsquo;s not to say there isn&rsquo;t anything left that could still be stripped away: burgess named things. Numbers appear on the screen to indicate the damage the hero deals or takes: this is enough to express the gradual powering up of the hero. Burgess, however, chose to name the different power levels. For example, in Pyramid &ldquo;10&rdquo; is called &ldquo;Imperious Axe of Truth&rdquo;. The monsters are also named.</p>

<p>In terms of how the game plays: it is smooth and fun. The game teaches us all the necessary mechanics in the first 3 levels, and then just gets tougher and tougher. The only thing that is left to us to discover is how combat works. I found out around level 12 that if you touch an enemy you attack it. That&rsquo;s not all though: unlike a run-of-the-mill rogue-like, it is possible to dance with enemies and outwit them. For me this is great: the game is not just a resource management slog, it involves patience and wit as well.</p>

<p>The game goes on forever, but I&rsquo;ve been assured that level 48 is the last time any new content is introduced.</p>
