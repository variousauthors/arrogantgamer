    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Meat&rsquo;s Edge is a first person take on the unforgiving twitch platformer,
that doesn&rsquo;t shy away from nausea and vomit. Missing a jump generally means
being torn into pink strips and recycled, rather than shimmying up a red pipe.</p>

<p>Meat&rsquo;s Edge takes human reflexes to the extreme. It takes all the vomit
inducing vertigo of <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2008/11/03"> Mirror&rsquo;s Edge </a> and just runs with it: camera angles are
spinning and flailing as your body rag-dolls madly after a failed landing.
More rolling, more cart-wheels, and more acrobatics. You spend the game
sprinting across rooftops, but unlike in Mirror&rsquo;s Edge the rooftops of this
<a href="http://aliendovecote.com/uploads/twine/tycoon/crime.html">post neo-capitalist global empire</a> are designed to deter runners with the same
vicious geometry that modern architecture leverages against pigeons and the
homeless. I&rsquo;m talking about spikes. This is is not a world that was designed
by the naive: they know what you are and what you do, and everything up here
is intended to stop you.</p>
