    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In Death Death Evolution, there is no escape. You must die to advance.
This game proposes a new relationship between the platform
jumper and the pits. In later stages I was actively looking for places
where I could die in a particular way, in order to unlock the tools I
might need later. There are even levels where you can die in irrelevant
ways, if you choose to, so that if you want to you can be stingy with death,
or feed her to bursting in order to fully 'power up'.</p>

<p>Nice game: I want more. More different animals, evolution abilities that
make more sense (I mean... I fell on spikes and could subsequently break
balloons with my head). I think we could take the mechanic of dying
for personal gain, switch up the theme a bit, and make a truly golden game
about ghosts or reincarnation or something.</p>

<p><blockquote class='imagine-with-me'><p>Let the player control people who are in touch with the spirit world. Mediums.<br/>You lead them about, and when they come in contact with a ghost they take on<br/>some aspect of that ghost's former life. At first, there are not ghosts and only<br/>a collection of living mediums. The player strategically kills off her mediums,<br/>forcing them to haunt the place of their death but also allowing later mediums to<br/>proceed further through the game. Perhaps there is an economy of souls, such that<br/>a player must be careful who is killed when.</p></blockquote></p>
