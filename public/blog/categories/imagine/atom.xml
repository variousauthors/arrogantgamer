    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In Vision by Proxy, you are a nearly blind extraterrestrial who sees by
stealing human eyes. When you steal a pair of eyes, looking out through them
gives you a different perspective on the world. A child&rsquo;s world is full
of magic, while an engineer sees the hidden uses of things. To progress
through the game, you must collect eyes.</p>

<p>Your alien character does not power up by collecting eyes. Instead you gradually
gain access to different interpretations of the level&rsquo;s layout. Thus, ideally,
the game is about remembering that you can more easily climb the little girl&rsquo;s
play-fort then the anime chick&rsquo;s Japanese temple. Some perspectives give you access
to the insides of things, or to a variety of floating platforms.</p>

<p>This game has evolved quite a bit since its initial incarnation, and some of my
original complaints have been addressed. In <a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/rosyPenguin/vision-by-proxy-2nd-ed">&ldquo;Vision by Proxy: Second Edition&rdquo;</a>,
there were only four eyes to collect, but in the more recent iteration
(<a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/Giraffasaurus/ms-vision-by-proxy">&ldquo;Ms Vision by Proxy&rdquo;</a>) we are introduced to seven or so. This is great! When
we enter a level we aren&rsquo;t certain what eyes will be available, and only after
developing a vocabulary of game objects we can begin to predict what eyes we need
in order to progress.</p>

<p>That being said, it still suffers from the levels being too big for the hero: the gameplay
is a little like a metroidvania, but the RPG elements are not played up enough for trekking back and forth across
the level to really be exciting. In addition, the puzzles are not really difficult or
focused and solving them ends up feeling inevitable. This game needs an overworld map, or teleportation, or something
to make the player feel like they are gathering information towards eventually solving
the puzzle, rather than just walking back and forth.</p>

<p>I think I&rsquo;d like to play a similar game in which there is no central &ldquo;main character&rdquo;.
Rather than having the one character collect all the other perspectives, the player
could switch between the perspectives, essentially teleporting around the level. This
way the player could get an overall sense of the layout without actually having to
trudge around it. Each available character would be trapped in some way by terrain
that they can&rsquo;t perceive their way around. In order to advance, the player would need
to gradually &ldquo;combine&rdquo; the available characters, allowing them to explore larger areas.
Maybe the characters are robots with different sensors that can literally combine to
share information. Maybe the characters don&rsquo;t occupy the same time/space, and each other
character appears as a ghost to the rest, haunting a particular location. Communicating
across this ethereal barrier could provide a mechanism for combining perspectives.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In Death Death Evolution, there is no escape. You must die to advance.
This game proposes a new relationship between the platform
jumper and the pits. In later stages I was actively looking for places
where I could die in a particular way, in order to unlock the tools I
might need later. There are even levels where you can die in irrelevant
ways, if you choose to, so that if you want to you can be stingy with death,
or feed her to bursting in order to fully &lsquo;power up&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Nice game: I want more. More different animals, evolution abilities that
make more sense (I mean&hellip; I fell on spikes and could subsequently break
balloons with my head). I think we could take the mechanic of dying
for personal gain, switch up the theme a bit, and make a truly golden game
about ghosts or reincarnation or something.</p>

<p>I guess that&rsquo;s what LD24 was all about.</p>
