  <div class="entry-content"><p>In Vision by Proxy, you are a nearly blind extraterrestrial who sees by
stealing human eyes. When you steal a pair of eyes, looking out through them
gives you a different perspective on the world. A child&#8217;s world is full
of magic, while an engineer sees the hidden uses of things. To progress
through the game, you must collect eyes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In Death Death Evolution, there is no escape. You must die to advance.
This game proposes a new relationship between the platform
jumper and the pits. In later stages I was actively looking for places
where I could die in a particular way, in order to unlock the tools I
might need later. There are even levels where you can die in irrelevant
ways, if you choose to, so that if you want to you can be stingy with death,
or feed her to bursting in order to fully &#8216;power up&#8217;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are three &#8216;zones&#8217;, collections of levels each of which give you a different flavor of game play. The
ambient &#8216;vanilla&#8217; levels build on the theme of &#8216;become the biggest&#8217;. The other two zones change game play
by introducing new elements: artificial lifeforms for you to compete with; and force attractors that act
as a center of gravity. I still haven&#8217;t figured out how to beat the force attractor levels, but the ambient
and survival levels are great! Beating three ai motes at once is tricky, and took me several tries.</p>

<p>Osmos contains one of my favorite underused mechanics: patience. I can
understand why this mechanic doesn&#8217;t get a lot of use. In Braid it was
presented only to the most hardcore, and in SS&amp;S EP it was an opt-in
system. In both cases, you didn&#8217;t have to play the waiting game if you
didn&#8217;t want to&#8230; but in Osmos you better get used to it. In the force
attractor levels you are in orbit around a central goo ball, and you
want to be the biggest. Playing these levels I felt like I had close
to zero agency. &#8220;Hey man still in orbit around the force attractor?&#8221;
&#8220;yeah, how bout you?&#8221; &#8220;yup. OK well, see you next time around.&#8221; With
each tearfully slow revolution you might pick up a tiny bit of mass,
and in this manner you grow. Admittedly, Osmos does give you the option
of speeding up time, which I discovered late in the levels by accident
(I don&#8217;t pay much attention to written instructions); even on fast
forward you still end up spinning in circles for an eternity before
you finally have enough mass to just leave and make a sandwich while
you become the biggest. Great game! But listen, that&#8217;s not all it takes.</p>

<p>In addition to patience, the game rewards the &#8216;letting go&#8217;. I guess it
is a very eastern-religion game in some sense: if you are aiming at
a particular goo ball, and in your clumsy sputtering you manage to
miss the mark, then you had better just let go. You could come to a full
stop and reverse your momentum, or try to come around for a second pass,
but in doing so you lose more than you probably will gain. The best
thing to do when you lose something (like in real life) is to adjust your
plan.</p>

<p>Patience: become the biggest, and never look back.</p>

<p>of which introduces a new element: opponents that behave
in one way or another; force attractors around which all the motes orbit;</p>

<p>The next few give us toy examples of the game&#8217;s &#8216;zones&#8217;, each of which tests us by introducing new elements.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You could play Osmos with no more instruction: the imperative to grow will guide you naturally
and inexorably. Despite its simplicity, Osmos does insist on spelling everything out in tutorial levels. I
really enjoy early learning stages in games, especially the ones that teach you about the world, rather than
the control scheme. I&#8217;m usually not pleased when English language words appear on the screen telling me
to tap X rapidly or whatnot. Unless the appearance of language is consistent with the theme of the game,
(like in Analogue, for example) this can be a real turn off. I&#8217;m going to go into some detail about the tutorial
levels (there are two) because I think Osmos is an excellent example of how easily a great beginning can
turn foul.</p>
