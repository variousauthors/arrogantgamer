Beneath the surface was a great theme. The interpretation that I liked most was "this is a game that seems to be one thing, but beneath the surface it is another." Generic Adventure Game hit that out of the park on multiple levels. 

The game starts with a beautiful misdirection, playing on the investment of player into avatar. For the first moments of the game you play a generic hero who can press A to kill an adorable slime for XP. The slime is the player, but the player won't understand this right away. 

The slime moves slowly and jumps without vigor. It moans existential questions that are ignored by an uncaring world. After a few moments of struggle and despair we are give an alternative: hold shift to dream. 

While holding shift you are playing a different game: you jump higher and move faster, there are no heroes to kill you and the landscape is lush, verdant, soft, and anti-aliased. You can hop around and explore, and in the meantime, on the surface, you are dying repeatedly. 

This is so cool! A game that sucks in which you can hold shift to play a fun game is just a totally rad idea. You can imagine where the game could go from there: perhaps the slime unlocks deep and ancient secrets, or saves the world (perhaps the player sometimes forgets they are holding shift); perhaps there are gates in the dream world that lead out to the aether beyond worlds, and the slime loses its connection to its body, only then learning to love it; perhaps the slime meets a spiritual guide that teaches it to bring its dream self to life. Perhaps! When your game starts with such brilliant underpinnings, where you take it is of little consequence. Generic Adventure Game does not disappoint. 

The slime is not vindictive. This too bears mention. I was really surprised by the primary action in the game, and delighted by how the slime chooses to react.
